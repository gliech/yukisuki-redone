yukisuki redone
====

This fork of the popular yukisuki startpage aims to provide a better out-of-the-box customizability, by removing the _config.json_ file and instead providing extensive documentation in the code and a clearer separation between content, presentation and behaviour. As a side effect this fork can work as a replacement for people who can not use the original yukisuki startpage in the chrome browser, because it blocks ajax from accessing local json files by default.
